# C .dll file encryptor
Hello, this is my first C/C++ project that I am proud enough to display.
<br>
I am still learning C, C++ and low level languages, so the code might not be perfectly optimized but it works and that is enough for me.
<br>
<br>
I used the [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) library to create this encryptor.
